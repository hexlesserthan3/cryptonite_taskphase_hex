# Implicit Relative Paths
## Question
We'll explore the mechanisms behind this concept later, but in this challenge, will learn how to explicitly use relative paths to launch run in this scenario. The way to do this is to tell Linux that you explicitly want to execute a program in the current directory, using . like in the previous levels. Give it a try now!

## Solution
![](/images/9.jpg)
1. moved to / folder
2. ran ./run from the challenge directory
