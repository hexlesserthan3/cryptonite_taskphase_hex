# Grepping errors
## Question
Try it now! Like the last level, this level will overwhelm you with output, but this time on standard error. Grep through it to find the flag!

1. used the >& operator to redirect the standard error to standard output
2. also used the grep command to get the pwn.college text

flag: pwn.college{sHg-EllywgwBFnpnp2qRJS_eVH5.dVDM5QDL4kDO1czW}
