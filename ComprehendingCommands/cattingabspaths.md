# Catting Absolute Paths
## Question
In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with cat at its absolute path: /flag.


## Solution
![](/images/2.jpg)
1. ls in the / directory to find the flag file
2. cat flag file to find the flag

flag: pwn.college{4ZwMlK1rn3ADzW0AVRTqpgZtvr2.dlTM5QDL4kDO1czW}
