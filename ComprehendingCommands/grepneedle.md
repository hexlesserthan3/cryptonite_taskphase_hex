# Grepping for a needle in a haystack
## Question
In this challenge, I've put a hundred thousand lines of text into the /challenge/data.txt file. Grep it for the flag!


## Solution
![](/images/4.jpg)
1. cd into the / dir
2. ran the recommended grep command (cleared the part where i cat the whole data file because i was curious what it would show)
3. got flag with pwn.college highlighted

flag: pwn.college{4raHB-zNwygRXFcz4jbBPKeT9T-.ddTM4QDL4kDO1czW}
